# IBM Quantum Challenge Fall 2022

This repository contains my solutions for the IBM Quantum Challenge Fall 2022.

Lab 1 is more-0r-less is crash course in qiskit, Lab 2 focuses on quantum machine learning, lab 3 focuses on optimization, graph problems, and the variational quantum eigensolver, and lab 4 is an application of quantum computing to quantum chemistry simulation.

More information about the challenge can be found in IBM's [announcement blog](https://www.research.ibm.com/blog/quantum-challenge-fall-2022) and the [FAQ / Wiki](https://github.com/qiskit-community/ibm-quantum-challenge-fall-22/wiki).
